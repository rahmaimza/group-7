# Project Overview

The objective of this project is to analyse and optimise a **transportation decision problem** using linear programming. The problem concerns the allocation of shipments from multiple supply locations to multiple demand locations in order to **minimise total transportation cost**, subject to operational constraints.

The project follows a **two-step methodological approach**, in line with the course requirements:

1. Formulation of a **deterministic transportation model**, assuming that all shipments are delivered with certainty and costs are known.
2. Extension of the baseline model to consider **uncertainty or scenario variation** (e.g. demand changes or cost sensitivity), building on the deterministic formulation.

This structure ensures that the core linear programming model is clearly defined before any generalisation or extension is introduced.

# Deterministic Transportation Model (Baseline)

## Decision Variables

Let:

* ( i = 1, \dots, I ) index the **supply nodes** (e.g. production plants, warehouses)
* ( j = 1, \dots, J ) index the **demand nodes** (e.g. customers, distribution centres)

We define the decision variables:

[
x_{ij} = \text{quantity transported from supply node } i \text{ to demand node } j
]

These variables represent the shipment quantities to be determined by the optimization model.

---

## Deterministic Assumptions

In the baseline model, the following assumptions are made:

* Transportation costs are known and constant.
* All shipments are delivered successfully.
* Supply and demand levels are fixed and known with certainty.

Under these assumptions, the problem can be formulated as a standard linear programming transportation model.

## Objective Function

The objective is to **minimise total transportation cost**:

[
\min \sum_{i=1}^{I} \sum_{j=1}^{J} c_{ij} , x_{ij}
]

where:

* ( c_{ij} ) is the unit transportation cost from supply node ( i ) to demand node ( j ).

---

## Constraints

### Supply Constraints

Each supply node has a limited capacity:

[
\sum_{j=1}^{J} x_{ij} \le S_i \quad \forall i
]

where ( S_i ) is the available supply at node ( i ).

---

### Demand Constraints

Each demand node must receive a required quantity:

[
\sum_{i=1}^{I} x_{ij} \ge D_j \quad \forall j
]

where ( D_j ) is the demand at node ( j ).

---

### Non-negativity Constraints

[
x_{ij} \ge 0 \quad \forall i,j
]

---

## Standard Linear Programming Form

The deterministic transportation problem can therefore be written as:

[
\begin{aligned}
\min \quad & \sum_{i=1}^{I} \sum_{j=1}^{J} c_{ij} x_{ij} \
\text{s.t.} \quad
& \sum_{j=1}^{J} x_{ij} \le S_i \quad \forall i \
& \sum_{i=1}^{I} x_{ij} \ge D_j \quad \forall j \
& x_{ij} \ge 0 \quad \forall i,j
\end{aligned}
]

This represents the **core linear programming formulation** of the project.

# Model Extension and Analysis

Once the deterministic model is established, it can be extended to analyse alternative scenarios, such as:

* changes in demand levels,
* variations in transportation costs,
* capacity restrictions on specific routes.

These extensions allow the decision-maker to evaluate how sensitive the optimal transportation plan is to changes in key parameters, while preserving the linear programming structure.

---

# Data Description

The model uses **real data provided for the project**, including:

* supply capacities at each origin node,
* demand requirements at each destination node,
* unit transportation costs for each route.

The total supply equals total demand, resulting in a **balanced transportation problem**, which is well suited for linear programming analysis.

---

# Methodology

The problem is solved using linear programming, specifically the transportation problem framework, which is a structured special case of LP. The model is implemented using standard optimization tools and solved with the Simplex method.
